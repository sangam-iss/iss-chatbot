**Executive Summary**

The term &#39;User Experience Design&#39; has been one of the buzz words that is driving **Industry 4.0.** What is UX and why is it so important?

According to Wikipedia, User Experience is a person&#39;s emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. In order to give the customer a better feel for the app and in order to get a competitive advantage, companies must invest in creating a good User Experience. One such UX that is of vital importance to many industries are Chatbots.

It acts as a trade-off between having a real customer agent (which adds up to the cost of the company) vs asking the customer to scroll through thousands of frequently asked questions (which can be a major frustration for most users). Demand for a chatbot is increasing day by day across many industries. We have identified that Singapore tourism can benefit from implementing a chatbot solution to recommend attractions to tourists.

Tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors in Singapore. According to 2018 Q4 report of Singapore Tourism Board, tourism sector achieved record highs in International Visitor Arrivals and Tourism receipts for the third year consecutively. Around 18.5 million visitors visited Singapore in 2018 and it accounted for Tourism Receipts of S$26.9 billion.

Due to the rapid growth of this sector, tourists can easily be overwhelmed with the options they have. In order to facilitate further growth in this sector and help the tourists, we have developed a chatbot application which can recommend attractions to tourists based on their interests. In addition to that it can also provide details regarding specific attractions, their opening and closing times, nearest MRT etc.
